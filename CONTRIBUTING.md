# pipepal pull request guidelines





Pull requests are always welcome, and we appreciate any help you give. Note that a code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the pipepal project, including issues and pull requests. Please see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

### Workflow
Please use the following workflow when contributing:
1. If you have access, add a task to the project board: https://github.com/orgs/sensein/projects/45
2. Create an issue (with the same name as the task, if applicable),
3. Use GitHub's "Create a branch" button from the issue page to generate a branch associated with the issue
4. Fork the issue branch
5. Work locally on the forked issue branch
6. Submit a pull request to merge the forked issue branch into the upstream issue branch
7. After the pull request from 6 is merged, submit a pull request to merge the upstream issue branch into upstream main

This approach ensures that tasks, issues, and branches all have names that clearly correspond. It also facilitates incremental neatly scoped changes since it tends to keep the scope of individual changes narrow.

When submitting a pull request, we ask you to check the following:

1. **Unit tests**, **documentation**, and **code style** are in order.
   See the Continuous Integration for up to date information on the current code style, tests, and any other requirements.

   It is also OK to submit work in progress if you're unsure of what this exactly means, in which case you'll likely be asked to make some further changes.

2. The contributed code will be **licensed under the same [license](LICENSE) as the rest of the repository**, If you did not write the code yourself, you must ensure the existing license is compatible and include the license information in the contributed files, or obtain permission from the original author to relicense the contributed code.
